Over an 8-block line, the home of an intoxicated person is at block 8, and a pub is at block 1. Our poor friend starts at block n,  1 &lt; n &lt; 8, and wanders at random, one block at a time, either toward home or toward the pub. At any intersection, our friend moves toward the pub with a probability of 3/5 and toward home with a probability of 2/5. When our friend arrives either at the pub or at home, they stay there.  Write a program to simulate 500 trips in which our friend starts at block 2, another 500 trips starting at block 3, and so forth up to block 7. For each starting point, calculate and print the percentage of time our friend ends up at home and the average number of blocks walked on each trip.
